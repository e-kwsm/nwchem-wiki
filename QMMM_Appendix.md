# QMMM Apppendix

## Preparing QM/MM calculations from scratch

Setting up QM/MM calculations for a new system for which classical force
analog is not readily available would typically involve the following
steps

1.  [Generation of the proper PDB file](#generation-of-the-proper-pdb-file)
2.  [Construction the fragment file(s)](#generation-of-new-fragment-files)
3.  [Creation of parameter file if new atom types were defined](#generation-of-new-parameter-files)

## Generation of the proper PDB file

It is often the case that the input structure for the system comes in
the form of the xyz file. Let us take a concrete example of N3O3-
molecule, which we would like to embed in classical solvent and perform
QM/MM calculations. Here is the structure of just N3O3- in xyz format
(generated in course of gas phase optimizations)
```

```
We cannot use this file as is in the QM/MM simulations, and it has to be
converted into PDB format. This is needed even if we plan to treat this
molecule quantum mechanically. There is more than way to do it. For
example, we could use Babel [https://openbabel.org](https://openbabel.org),
which will generate the PDB file as

 END
```
This is not yet the format we want. So what we need to do is

1. *replace HETATM field by ATOM preserving the format (column
locations) of the rest of the file*:

I would typically use sed for this purpose
```
 sed 's/HETATM/ATOM  /' n3o3-bad.pdb > n3o3-step1.pdb
```
where `n3o3-bad.pdb` is the original pdb file from Babel and
`n3o3-step1.pdb` is the converted one as shown below
```
ATOM      1  O   LIG     1       1.562   0.180  -1.368  1.00  0.00           O  
ATOM      2  N   LIG     1       1.316   0.936  -0.424  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      3  N   LIG     1       2.364   1.026   0.488  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      4  O   LIG     1       3.472   0.429   0.421  1.00  0.00           O  
ATOM      5  N   LIG     1       1.958   1.906   1.488  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      6  O   LIG     1       2.814   2.068   2.361  1.00  0.00           O  
END
```
2. *define residues (aka molecules):*

In our case Babel did this for us and the entire system is defined as
one residue with the name LIG (see columns 4 and 5). We can leave it as,
but I will redefine residue name to NN3 (keep it to 3 characters !).
Again running `sed 's/LIG/NN3/' n3o3-step1.pdb > n3o3-step2.pdb`
```
ATOM      1  O   NN3     1       1.562   0.180  -1.368  1.00  0.00           O  
ATOM      2  N   NN3     1       1.316   0.936  -0.424  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      3  N   NN3     1       2.364   1.026   0.488  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      4  O   NN3     1       3.472   0.429   0.421  1.00  0.00           O  
ATOM      5  N   NN3     1       1.958   1.906   1.488  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      6  O   NN3     1       2.814   2.068   2.361  1.00  0.00           O  
END
```
You could have also broken it up into several residues as
```
ATOM      1  O   NN2     1       1.562   0.180  -1.368  1.00  0.00           O  
ATOM      2  N   NN2     1       1.316   0.936  -0.424  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      3  N   NN2     1       2.364   1.026   0.488  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      4  O   NN2     1       3.472   0.429   0.421  1.00  0.00           O  
ATOM      5  N   NN1     2       1.958   1.906   1.488  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      6  O   NN1     2       2.814   2.068   2.361  1.00  0.00           O  
END
```
where I defined two residues NN2 and NN1 (note changes in columns 4 and
5). To keep things simple I will stay with one residue version for now

3. *make unique atom names*:

This has to do with the requirement that all atoms names have to be
unique within a given residue. So if we take our one residue version it
could be modified as (notice column 3)
```
ATOM      1  O1  NN3     1       1.562   0.180  -1.368  1.00  0.00           O  
ATOM      2  N1  NN3     1       1.316   0.936  -0.424  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      3  N2  NN3     1       2.364   1.026   0.488  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      4  O2  NN3     1       3.472   0.429   0.421  1.00  0.00           O  
ATOM      5  N3  NN3     2       1.958   1.906   1.488  1.00  0.00           N  
ATOM      6  O3  NN3     2       2.814   2.068   2.361  1.00  0.00           O  
END
```
Now we have a PDB file for our system in "proper" PDB format. Before we
move to next step, I should mention that the last 3 columns are not
necessary and could have been removed at any point leading to
[n3o3.pdb](n3o3.pdb)
```
ATOM      1  O1  NN3     1       1.562   0.180  -1.368      
ATOM      2  N1  NN3     1       1.316   0.936  -0.424      
ATOM      3  N2  NN3     1       2.364   1.026   0.488      
ATOM      4  O2  NN3     1       3.472   0.429   0.421      
ATOM      5  N3  NN3     2       1.958   1.906   1.488      
ATOM      6  O3  NN3     2       2.814   2.068   2.361      
END
```
## Generation of new fragment files

While setting up QM/MM calculations is often necessary to generate new
fragment files for the molecules that are not available as part of
standard set. The IMPORTANT assumption here is that these new
molecules/residues will be part of OQM region, and as a result only
minimum information needs to be provided to include them in QM/MM
calculations.

First we must ensure that we have a proper PDB format for our as
discussed in the [Generation of the proper PDB file
](#generation-of-the-proper-pdb-file) section. As a concrete
example we will start with N3O3 example that was discussed there as well
```
ATOM      1  O1  NN3     1       1.562   0.180  -1.368      
ATOM      2  N1  NN3     1       1.316   0.936  -0.424      
ATOM      3  N2  NN3     1       2.364   1.026   0.488      
ATOM      4  O2  NN3     1       3.472   0.429   0.421      
ATOM      5  N3  NN3     1       1.958   1.906   1.488      
ATOM      6  O3  NN3     1       2.814   2.068   2.361      
END
```
We have residue named NN3 and therefore looking to construct fragment
file `NN3.frg`. The best way to do it is to run a simple prepare job
```
start n3o3  
  
prepare  
source n3o3.pdb  
new_top new_seq  
new_rst  
modify segment 1 quantum   
update lists  
ignore  
write n3o3_ref.pdb  
write n3o3_ref.rst  
end  
  
task prepare
```
This prepare job will necessarily fail because NN3.frg is not yet
available:
```
Created fragment                      ./NN3.frg_TMP  
  
Unresolved atom types in fragment NN3  
  
  
 **********  
 *   0: pre_mkfrg failed 9999  
 **********
```
As part of this process skeleton fragment file (`NN3.frg_TMP`) will be
generated that can be modified into the final correct form. Let us take
a look at `NN3.frg_TMP`
```
# This is an automatically generated fragment file  
# Atom types and connectivity were derived from coordinates  
# Atomic partial charges are crude estimates  
# 00/00/00  00:00:00    
#  
$NN3  
    6    1    1    0  
NN3  
    1 O1             0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    2 N1             0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    3 N2             0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    4 O2             0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    5 N3             0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    6 O3             0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    1    2  
    2    3  
    3    4  
    3    5  
    5    6
```
The main problem with this fragment file is that there are no atom types
to be found in column 12. What atom type does is to identify what
classical parameters should be assigned to it. Since, as mentioned in
the beginning, we are planing to treat this residue/molecule as part of
QM region, the only classical information needed is VDW parameters. We
will assume that all nitrogens atoms in our molecule can use the same
set of parameters, and the same for oxygens. Therefore we will define
two atom types NX and OX  
```
$NN3  
    6    1    1    0  
NN3  
    1 O1   OX        0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    2 N1   NX        0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    3 N2   NX        0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    4 O2   OX        0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    5 N3   NX        0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    6 O3   OX        0    0    0    1    1    0.000000    0.000000  
    1    2  
    2    3  
    3    4  
    3    5  
    5    6
```
and rename resulting file as [NN3.frg](NN3.frg). Please
note that the overall format of the fragment file was preserved and atom
types were entered starting at column 12. Rerunning the same prepare job
moves as a bit further this time
```

```
complaining now that atom types OX and NX are not defined. This brings
us to the next step of defining new parameter file for our calculation. 

## Generation of new parameter files

Continuing with our fragment construction in [Generation of new fragment
files](#generation-of-new-fragment-files) section, we now
need to define VDW parameters for our new atom types NX and OX. The best
way to do it is to create `amber.par` file in the directory where you plan
to rerun final prepare  
```

Relative dielectric constant     1.000000

      Q       7 3.55640E-01 1.82400E-01  
OX     16.00000 6.35968E-01 1.76830E-01                            1 1111111111  
      Q       8 3.17984E-01 1.76830E-01  
End
```
The format of this file is documented in [Format of NWChem parameter
file](#format-of-nwchem-parameter-file). How to actually
choose the appropriate values for VDW parameters is a whole new subject,
which I do not think anybody yet fully addressed. The practical strategy
is to copy from known atom types, which are chemically similar to the
ones in your system. In the case above I copied parameters from standard
AMBER atom types N and OW.

## Format of NWChem parameter file

The format of NWChem parameter is illustrated on the figure below and
also available as [pdf file](Parameter-file.pdf).

![Format of NWChem parameter file](Nwchem-parameter-file.png)

## Conversion of standard AMBER program parameter files

Fortran code that performs conversion from AMBER program parameter file
format to NWChem can be found [here](amber-helper.tgz).
It works by parsing out free format AMBER style parameter file contained
in `amber.in`
