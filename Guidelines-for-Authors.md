# **TO BE REVISED. MOST OF THE CONTENT HERE IS OBSOLETE**

The current wiki has
been created to provide documentation related to NWChem. This
includes the user manual, tutorials and common practices, as well as
programmer references, as well as other useful information. In order to
make this wiki as useful as possible to the NWChem community a certain
level of consistency of style is useful. To assist with this and because
of the nature of the subject matter of this specific wiki a number of
tools and extensions have been selected to help document relevant
aspects. These tools and suggestions for their use will be discussed
here as well. Obviously for general information on these tools external
references will be used.

## Tools

This wiki has a number of extensions installed to facilitate the
documentation process for which it is intended. The configuration of the
wiki installation can found at
[Special:Version](Special:Version). For the purpose of this
wiki there are a number of aspects that are relevant. These include
[Links](#links),
[Pictures](#pictures).

### Links


#### Intra wiki links to other pages




#### Pictures

There are a variety of situations where the best way to show something
is to provide a picture. In order to do this the image file has to be
uploaded (see the [Upload](Special:Upload) page) to the wiki
server. Next a link on the wiki page to the image file has be included.
In order to avoid trampling over previously uploaded image files it is
recommended to check the list of previously uploaded files at the
[ListFiles](Special:ListFiles) page.

As an example the (old) NWChem logo image is used. First the picture was
included on with wiki page using

` `  
`  [[file:Nwchem_logo_dark.png|NWChem logo]]`  
`  `

to give

` `[`NWChem`` ``logo`](file:Nwchem_logo_dark.png)

Alternatively the construct

` `  
`  [[media:Nwchem_logo_dark.png]]`  
`  `

gives

` `[`media:Nwchem_logo_dark.png`](media:Nwchem_logo_dark.png)

## Movies

The effort to add movies to the Wiki pages is under development.
