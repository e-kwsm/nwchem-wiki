```
This directive specifies ECP basis set on fluoride link atoms. If set to
auto the ECP basis set given by Zhang, Lee, Yang for 6-31G\* basis.35.2
will be used. Strictly speaking, this implies the use of 6-31G\*
spherical basis as the main basis set. If other choices are desired then
keyword user should be used and ECP basis set should be entered
separately following the format given in section 8. The name tag for
fluoride link atoms is F\_L.
