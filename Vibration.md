## Vibrational frequencies

The nuclear hessian which is used to compute the vibrational frequencies
can be computed by finite difference for any ab initio wave-function
that has analytic gradients or by analytic methods for SCF and DFT (see
[Hessians](Hessians-and-Vibrational-Frequencies) for details). The appropriate nuclear
hessian generation algorithm is chosen based on the user input when TASK
<theory> frequencies is the task directive.

The vibrational package was integrated from the Utah Messkit and can use
any nuclear hessian generated from the driver routines, finite
difference routines or any analytic hessian modules. There is no
required input for the "VIB" package. VIB computes the Infra Red
frequencies and intensities for the computed nuclear hessian and the
"projected" nuclear hessian. The VIB module projects out the
translations and rotations of the nuclear hessian using the standard
Eckart projection algorithm. It also computes the zero point energy for
the molecular system based on the frequencies obtained from the
projected hessian.

The default mass of each atom is used unless an alternative mass is
provided via the [geometry](Geometry) input or redefined
using the vibrational module input. The default mass is the mass of the
most abundant isotope of each element. If the abundance was roughly
equal, the mass of the isotope with the longest half life was used.

In addition, the vibrational analysis is given at the default standard
temperature of 298.15 degrees.

#  Vibrational Module Input

All input for the Vibrational Module is optional since the default
definitions will compute the frequencies and IR intensities. The generic
module input can begin with vib, freq, frequency and has the form:
```
 {freq || vib || frequency}  
   [reuse [<string hessian_filename>]]  
   [mass <integer lexical_index> <real new_mass>]  
   [mass <string tag_identifier> <real new_mass>]  
   [{temp || temperature} <integer number_of_temperatures> \  
         <real temperature1 temperature2 ...>]  
   [animate [<real step_size_for_animation>]]  
 end
```
### Hessian File Reuse

By default the task <theory> frequencies directive will recompute the
hessian. To reuse the previously computed hessian you need only specify
reuse in the module input block. If you have stored the hessian in an
alternate place you may redirect the reuse directive to that file by
specifying the path to that file.
```
 reuse /path_to_hessian_file
```
This will reuse your saved Hessian data but one caveat is that the
geometry specification at the point where the hessian is computed must
be the default "geometry" on the current run-time-data-base for the
projection to work properly.

### Redefining Masses of Elements

You may also modify the mass of a specific center or a group of centers
via the input.

To modify the mass of a specific center you can simply use:
```
 mass 3 4.00260324
```
which will set the mass of center 3 to 4.00260324 AMUs. The lexical
index of centers is determined by the geometry object.

To modify all Hydrogen atoms in a molecule you may use the tag based
mechanism:
```
 mass hydrogen 2.014101779
```
The mass redefinitions always start with the default masses and change
the masses in the order given in the input. Care must be taken to change
the masses properly. For example, if you want all hydrogens to have the
mass of Deuterium and the third hydrogen (which is the 6th atomic
center) to have the mass of Tritium you must set the Deuterium masses
first with the tag based mechanism and then set the 6th center's mass to
that of Tritium using the lexical center index mechanism.

The mass redefinitions are not fully persistent on the
run-time-data-base. Each input block that redefines masses will
invalidate the mass definitions of the previous input block. For
example,
```
freq  
  reuse  
  mass hydrogen 2.014101779  
end  
task scf frequencies  
freq  
  reuse  
  mass oxygen 17.9991603  
end  
task scf frequencies
```
will use the new mass for all hydrogens in the first frequency analysis.
The mass of the oxygen atoms will be redefined in the second frequency
analysis but the hydrogen atoms will use the default mass. To get a
modified oxygen and hydrogen analysis you would have to use:
```
freq  
  reuse  
  mass hydrogen 2.014101779  
end  
task scf frequencies  
freq  
  reuse  
  mass hydrogen 2.014101779  
  mass oxygen 17.9991603  
end  
task scf frequencies
```
### Temp or Temperature

The "VIB" module can generate the vibrational analysis at various
temperatures other than at standard room temperature. Either temp or
temperature can be used to initiate this command.

To modify the temperature of the computation you can simply use:
```
 temp 4 298.15 300.0 350.0 400.0
```
At this point, the temperatures are persistent and so the user must
"reset" the temperature if the standard behavior is required after
setting the temperatures in a previous "VIB" command, i.e.
```
 temp 1 298.15
```
### Animation

The "VIB" module also can generate mode animation input files in the
standard xyz file format for graphics packages like RasMol or XMol There
are scripts to automate this for RasMol in
$NWCHEM\_TOP/contrib/rasmolmovie. Each mode will have 20 xyz files
generated that cycle from the equilibrium geometry to 5 steps in the
positive direction of the mode vector, back to 5 steps in the negative
direction of the mode vector, and finally back to the equilibrium
geometry. By default these files are not generated. To activate this
mechanism simply use the following input directive
```
 animate
```
anywhere in the frequency/vib input block.

#### Controlling the Step Size Along the Mode Vector

By default, the step size used is 0.15 a.u. which will give reliable
animations for most systems. This can be changed via the input directive
```
 animate real <step_size>
```
where <step_size> is the real number that is the magnitude of each step
along the eigenvector of each nuclear hessian mode in atomic units.
