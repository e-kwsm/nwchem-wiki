# Interfaces to Other Programs

NWChem has interfaces to several different packages which are listed
below. In general, the NWChem authors work with the authors of the other
packages to make sure that the interface works. However, any problems
with the interface should be reported through the github issue page https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem/issues

### Introduction

By using DIRDYVTST, a user can carry out electronic structure
calculations with NWChem and use the resulting energies, gradients, and
Hessians for direct dynamics calculations with [POLYRATE](https://comp.chem.umn.edu/polyrate/). 
This program
prepares the file30 input for POLYRATE from NWChem electronic structure
calculations of energies, gradients and Hessians at the reactant,
product, and saddle point geometries and along the minimum energy path.
Cartesian geometries for the reactants, products, and saddle points need
to be input to this program; optimization of geometries is not performed
in this program. Note that DIRDYVTST is based on the DIRDYGAUSS program
and is similar to two other programs: DDUTILITIES and GAUSSRATE. Users
of this module are encouraged to read the [POLYRATE manual](https://comp.chem.umn.edu/polyrate/190727_Polyrate_17-C_manuall.pdf) since they
will need to create the file fu5 input to run calculations with
POLYRATE.

Notes about the code:

Input. The code has been written to parallel, as much as possible, the
POLYRATE code.

Output. There is one default output file for each DIRDYVTST run -
.file30.

Integrators for following the reaction path. Currently the Euler and
three Page-McIver (PM) methods are implemented. The PM methods are the
local quadratic approximation (LQA), the corrected LQA (CLQA), and the
cubic (CUBE) algorithm. The PM methods are implemented so that the
Hessian can be reused at intermediate steps at which only the gradient
is updated.

### Files

Test runs are located in directories in $NWCHEM\_TOP/QA/tests. Test runs
are available for two systems: H + H<sub>2</sub> and OH + H<sub>2</sub>.

The H + H<sub>2</sub> test uses the Euler integration method at the SCF/3-21G
level of theory to calculate points along the reaction path. This test
is located in the $NWCHEM\_TOP/QA/tests/h3tr1 directory.

The OH + H<sub>2</sub> test uses the Page-McIver CUBE algorithm to calculate
points on the SCF/3-21G surface and does additional single point
calculations at the SCF/6-31G\* level of theory. This test is located in
the $NWCHEM\_TOP/QA/tests/oh3tr3 directory.

Note: These tests are set up with SCF, however, other levels of theory
can be used. The initial hessian calculations at the reactants, products
and saddle point can cause some problems when numerical hessians are
required (especially when there is symmetry breaking in the
wavefunction).

### Detailed description of the input

The input consists of keywords for NWChem and keywords related to
POLYRATE input. The first set of inputs are for NWChem with the general
input block of the
form:
```
 DIRDYVTST [autosym [real tol default 1d-2] | noautosym]  
   [THEORY <string theory> [basis <string basis default "ao basis">] \  
                        [ecp <string ecp>] [input <string input>]]  
   [SPTHEORY <string theory> [basis <string basis default "ao basis">]   
                        [ecp <string ecp>] [input <string input>`]]  
   ...
 END
```
#### Use of symmetry

The use of symmetry in the calculation is controlled by the keyword
`autosym | noautosym` which is used as described in the
[geometry](Geometry.md) directive. `Autosym` is on by
default. A couple words of warning here. The tolerance related to
`autosym` can cause problems when taking the initial step off of the
transition state. If the tolerance is too large and the initial step
relatively small, the resulting geometry will be close to a higher
symmetry than is really wanted and the molecule will be symmetrized into
the higher symmetry. To check this, the code prints out the symmetry at
each geometry along the path. It is up to the user to check the symmetry
and make sure that it is the required one. In perverse cases, the user
may need to turn autosym off (noautosym) if changing the tolerance
doesn't produce the desired results. In the case that autosym is used,
the user does not need to worry about the different alignment of the
molecule between NWChem and POLYRATE, this is taken care of internally
in the DIRDYVTST module.

#### Basis specification

The basis name on the theory or sptheory directive is that specified on
a [basis set directive](Basis.md) and not the name of
a standard basis in the library. If not specified, the basis set for the
sptheory defaults to the theory basis which defaults to "ao basis".

#### Effective core potentials

If an [effective core potential](ECP.md) is specified
in the usual fashion outside of the DIRDYVTST input then this will be
used in all calculations. If an alternative ECP name (the name specified
on the ECP directive in the same manner as done for basis sets) is
specified on one of the theory directives, then this ECP will be used in
preference for that level of theory.

#### General input strings

For many purposes, the ability to specify the theory, basis and
effective core potential is adequate. All of the options for each theory
are determined from their independent input blocks. However, if the same
theory (e.g., DFT) is to be used with different options for theory and
sptheory, then the general input strings must be used. These strings are
processed as NWChem input each time the theoretical calculation is
invoked. The strings may contain any NWChem input, except for options
pertaining to DIRDYVTST and the task directive. The intent is that the
strings be used just to control the options pertaining to the theory
being used.

A word of caution. Be sure to check that the options are producing the
desired results. Since the NWChem database is persistent, the input
strings should fully define the calculation you wish to have happen.

For instance, if the theory model is DFT/LDA/3-21g and the sptheory
model is DFT/B3LYP/6-311g\*\*, the DIRDYVTST input might look like this
```
   dirdyvtst  
     theory  dft basis 3-21g    input "dft\; xc\; end"  
     sptheory dft basis 6-311g** input "dft\; xc b3lyp\; end"  
     ....  
   end
```
The empty XC directive restores the default [LDA exchange-correlation
functional](Density-Functional-Theory-for-Molecules#xc-and-decomp-exchange-correlation-potentials).
Note that semi-colons and other quotation marks inside the input string
must be preceded by a backslash to avoid special interpretation.

#### POLYRATE related options

These keyword options are similar to the POLYRATE input format, except
there are no ENERGETICS, OPTIMIZATION, SECOND, TUNNELING, and RATE
sections.

##### GENERAL section

The GENERAL section has the following format:
```
  * GENERAL

 [TITLE <string title>]  
 ATOMS  
   <integer num> <string tag> [<real mass>]  
   ...  
 END  
 [SINGLEPOINT]  
 [SAVEFILE (vecs || hess || spc)
```
Descriptions

TITLE is a keyword that allows the user to input a description of the
calculation. In this version, the user can only have a single-line
description.

For example:

`   TITLE Calculation of D + HCl reaction`

ATOMS is a list keyword that is used to input a list of the atoms. It is
similar to POLYRATE in that the order of the atom and the atomic symbol
are required in a single line. If isotope of the element is considered
then the atomic mass is required in units of amu.

For example:
```
                         ATOMS  
                           1     H     2.014  
                           2     H  
                           3     Cl  
                         END`
```
SINGLEPOINT is a keyword that specifies that a single point calculation
is to be performed at the reactants, products and saddle point
geometries. The type of single point calculation is specified in the
sptheory line.

SAVEFILE is a keyword that specifies that NWChem files are to be saved.
Allowed values of variable input to SAVEFILE are vecs, hess, and spc for
saving the files base theory movecs, base theory hessian and singlepoint
calculation movecs.

##### REACT1, REACT2, PROD1, PROD2, and START sections

These sections have the following
format:
```
*(REACT1 || REACT2 || PROD1 || PROD2 || START)  
  GEOM  
    <integer num> <real x y z>  
    ...  
  END  
  SPECIES (ATOMIC || LINRP || NONLINRP || LINTS || NONLINTS default NONLINRP)
```
REACT1 and REACT2 are input for each of the reactants and PROD1 and
PROD2 are input for each of the products. REACT1 and PROD1 are required.
START is the input for the transition state if one exists, or starting
point to follow downhill the MEP.

Descriptions

GEOM is a list keyword that indicates the geometry of the molecule in
Cartesian coordinates with atomic unit.

For example:
```
                         GEOM  
                            1      0.0     0.0     0.0  
                            2      0.0     0.0     1.5  
                         END
```
SPECIES is a variable keyword that indicates the type of the molecule.
Options are: ATOMIC (atomic reactant or product), LINRP (linear reactant
or product), NONLINRP (nonlinear reactant or product), LINTS (linear
transition state), and NONLINTS (nonlinear transition state).

For example:

`  SPECIES atomic`

##### PATH section

The Path section has the format:
```
*PATH  
 [SCALEMASS <real scalemass default 1.0>]  
 [SSTEP <real sstep default 0.01>]  
 [SSAVE <real ssave default 0.1>]  
 [SHESS <real shess default SSAVE>]  
 [SLP <real slp default 1.0>]  
 [SLM <real slm default -1.0>]  
 [SIGN (REACTANT || PRODUCT default REACTANT)]  
 [INTEGRA (EULER || LQA || CLQA || CUBE default EULER)] 
 [PRINTFREQ (on || off default off)]
```
Descriptions

SCALEMASS is a variable keyword that indicates the arbitrary mass (in
amu) used for mass-scaled Cartesian coordinates. This is the variable
called mu in published papers. Normally, this is taken as either 1.0 amu
or, for bimolecular reactions, as the reduced mass of relative
translation of the reactants.

SSTEP is a variable keyword that indicates the numerical step size (in
bohrs) for the gradient grid. This is the step size for following the
minimum energy path.

SSAVE is a variable keyword that indicates the numerical step size (in
bohrs) for saving the Hessian grid. At each save point the potential and
its first and second derivatives are recalculated and written to the
.file30 file. For example, if SSTEP=0.01 and SSAVE=0.1, then the
potential information is written to .file30 every 10 steps along the
gradient grid.

SHESS is a variable keyword that indicates the numerical step size (in
bohrs) for recomputing the Hessian when using a Page-McIver integrator
(e.g., LQA, CLQA, or CUBE). For Euler integration SHESS = SSAVE. For
intermediate points along the gradient grid, the Hessian matrix from the
last Hessian calculation is reused. For example, if SSTEP=0.01 and
SHESS=0.05, then the Hessian matrix is recomputed every 5 steps along
the gradient grid.

SLP is a variable keyword that indicates the positive limit of the
reaction coordinate (in bohrs).

SLM is a variable keyword that indicates the negative limit of the
reaction coordinate (in bohrs).

SIGN is a variable keyword used to ensure the conventional definition of
the sign of s, s \< 0 for the reactant side and s \> 0 for the product
side, is followed. PRODUCT should be used if the eigenvector at the
saddle point points toward the product side and REACTANT if the
eigenvector points toward the reactant side.

INTEGRA is a variable keyword that indicates the integration method used
to follow the reaction path. Options are: EULER, LQA, CLQA, and CUBE.

PRINTFREQ is a variable keyword that indicates that projected
frequencies and eigenvectors will be printed along the MEP.

#### Restart

DIRDYVTST calculations should be
[restarted](Start_Restart.md)
through the normal NWChem mechanism. The user needs to change the start
directive to a restart directive and get rid of any information that
will overwrite important information in the RTDB. The file.db and
file.file30 need to be available for the calculation to restart
properly.

#### Example

This is an example that creates the file30 file for POLYRATE for
H + H<sub>2</sub>. Note that the multiplicity is that of the entire
supermolecule, a doublet. In this example, the initial energies,
gradients, and Hessians are calculated at the UHF/3-21G level of theory
and the singlepoint calculations are calculated at the MP2/cc-pVDZ level
of theory with a tighter convergence threshold than the first SCF.
