The structure of the system in QM/MM calculations is provided by the
restart file (extension .rst) and not by the geometry block as it would
be for pure QM calculations. The parameters of classical interaction are
given by the topology file (extension .top). These two files are
**REQUIRED** for QM/MM calculations and can be generated by the [prepare
module](Prepare). In a typical setting this "preparation
stage" is performed separately from the main QM/MM simulation.
